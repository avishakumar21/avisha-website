      <description>Continuous evaluation of clinical metrics necessitates integrated computer vision algorithms to detect relevant features from ultrasound images. Clinical motivation Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to adverse physiological effects following the initial trauma, including reduced blood flow to the injury site (hematoma). This secondary injury may last for weeks or months and inhibits patient recovery. The standard treatment approaches do not guarantee sufficient local blood flow restoration, and optimally titrating new therapies remains a challenge due to the lack of real-time and automatic monitoring of spinal cord parameters such as hematoma development and tissue inflammation.</description>

      <description>Generating acoustic phantoms of patient-specific spinal cords to investigate the theraputic efficacy of focused ultrasound transducer placement Spinal cord injury is a devastatingAn estimated 900,000 incident cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) were reported globally in 2019, predominantly resulting from falls, road injuries, and conflicts [1]. The clinical manifestations of SCI can worsen with secondary damage due to inflammation and swelling restricting blood flow to the cord, with devastating socioeconomic consequences for patients [2].</description>

      <description>Formspree makes it easy to receive submissions from HTML forms on your static website. Functional Form This theme has a form-to-email feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (/content/forms/contact.md). Of course, the example shown below (your@email.here) must not be used. Please use your actual email address.</description>
