The mission of the Space Systems Design Studion is pioneering multiple techniques that have the potential to fundamentally change deep space exploration. Highlighted innovations include, but are not limited to: a primarily 3D printed spacecraft structure, the use of a RockBlock modem for decentralized communication, the placement of holograms on the spacecraft, and of course, the first release of a free-flying light sail into Low Earth Orbit. This project has been approved by NASA for spaceflight! 

My research primarily focused on developing the electrical subsystem, where I designed and tested the printed circuit boards and electrical subcomponents of the satellite, and integrated the power system with solar cells.
