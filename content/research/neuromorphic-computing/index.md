For my Masters Thesis at Cornell University (2019-2020), I worked on developing a computational system to emulate the mammalian olfactory system using chemosensors, microcontrollers, and a machine learning classification algorithm. The goal for this system is to learn and classify new odors rapidly and robustly despite interference from other smells, much like our own olfactory system. More information on my thesis can be found in the link above!
