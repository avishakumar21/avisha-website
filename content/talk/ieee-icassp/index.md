Abstract: While significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)
have catalyzed progress across various domains, its full potential in understanding visual perception remains underexplored. We propose an artificial neural network dubbed VISION, an acronym for “Visual Interface System for Imaging Output of Neural activity,” to mimic the human brain and
show how it can foster neuroscientific inquiries. Using visual and contextual inputs, this multimodal model predicts the
brain’s functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan
response to natural images. VISION successfully predicts
human hemodynamic responses as fMRI voxel values to visual inputs with an accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art performance by 45%. We further probe the trained networks to
reveal representational biases in different visual areas, generate experimentally testable hypotheses, and formulate an interpretable metric to associate these hypotheses with cortical
functions. With both a model and evaluation metric, the cost
and time burdens associated with designing and implementing functional analysis on the visual cortex could be reduced.
Our work suggests that the evolution of computational models may shed light on our fundamental understanding of the
visual cortex and provide a viable approach toward reliable
brain-machine interfaces.
