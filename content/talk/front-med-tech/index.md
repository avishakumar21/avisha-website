Abstract: Tissue elasticity remains an essential biomarker of health and is indicative of irregularities such as tumors or infection. The timely detection of such abnormalities is crucial for the prevention of disease progression and complications that arise from late-stage illnesses. However, at both the bedside and the operating table, there is a distinct lack of tactile feedback for deep-seated tissue. As surgical techniques advance toward remote or minimally invasive options to reduce infection risk and hasten healing time, surgeons lose the ability to manually palpate tissue. Furthermore, palpation of deep structures results in decreased accuracy, with the additional barrier of needing years of experience for adequate confidence of diagnoses. This review delves into the current modalities used to fulfill the clinical need of quantifying physical touch. It covers research efforts involving tactile sensing for remote or minimally invasive surgeries, as well as the potential of ultrasound elastography to further this field with non-invasive real-time imaging of the organâ€™s biomechanical properties. Elastography monitors tissue response to acoustic or mechanical energy and reconstructs an image representative of the elastic profile in the region of interest. This intuitive visualization of tissue elasticity surpasses the tactile information provided by sensors currently used to augment or supplement manual palpation. Focusing on common ultrasound elastography modalities, we evaluate various sensing mechanisms used for measuring tactile information and describe their emerging use in clinical settings where palpation is insufficient or restricted. With the ongoing advancements in ultrasound technology, particularly the emergence of micromachined ultrasound transducers, these devices hold great potential in facilitating early detection of tissue abnormalities and providing an objective measure of patient health.
