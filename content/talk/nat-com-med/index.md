Abstract: 
Background: Tension in the spinal cord is a trademark of tethered cord syndrome. Unfortunately, existing tests cannot quantify tension across the bulk of the cord, making the diagnostic evaluation of stretch ambiguous. A potential non-destructive metric for spinal cord tension is ultrasound-derived shear wave velocity (SWV). The velocity is sensitive to tissue elasticity and boundary conditions including strain. We use the term Ultrasound Tensography to describe the acoustic evaluation of tension with SWV.

Methods: Our solution “Tethered cord Assessment with Ultrasound Tensography (TAUT)” was utilized in three sub-studies: finite element simulations, a cadaveric benchtop validation, and a neurosurgical case series. The simulation computed SWV for given tensile forces. The induced tension cadaveric model validated the SWV-tension relationship. Lastly, SWV was measured intraoperatively in patients diagnosed with tethered cord who underwent surgical treatment (spinal column shortening). The surgery alleviates tension by decreasing the vertebral column length.

Results: Here we observe a strong linear relationship between tension and squared SWV across the preclinical sub-studies. Higher tension induces faster shear waves in the simulation (R2 = 0.984) and cadaveric (R2 = 0.951) models. The SWV decreases in all neurosurgical procedures (p<0.001). Moreover, TAUT has a c-statistic of 0.962 (0.92-1.00), detecting all tethered cords.

Conclusions: This study presents the first clinical metric of spinal cord tension. Strong agreement among computational, cadaveric, and clinical studies demonstrates the utility of ultrasound-induced SWV for quantitative intraoperative feedback. This technology is positioned to enhance tethered cord diagnosis, treatment, and post-operative monitoring as it differentiates stretched from healthy cords.
