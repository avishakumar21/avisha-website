  Hi! I joined Johns Hopkins University in August 2021 and am a third year PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. My research is at the intersection machine learning and medicine. I am currently working on optimizing focused ultrasound therapy with acoustic wave modeling and operator learning. I am affilated with the [Neuroengineering Lab](https://neuroengineering.bme.jhu.edu/) and the [HEPIUS Lab](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology-neurosurgery/research/hepius).

  I recieved my Bachelor's of Science (Dec 2019) and Master of Engineering (May 2020) degrees at Cornell University [Master’s Thesis](). At Cornell, I was a member of the [Space Systems Design Studio](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/), with the research focus of spacecraft electrical system development. After completing my Masters, I spent a year as a computational neuroscience research scientist at Yale School of Medicine in the Blumenfeld Lab.
