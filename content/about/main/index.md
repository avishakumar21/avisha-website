  Hi! I joined Johns Hopkins University in August 2021 as a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. My research is at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. I work on optimizing focused ultrasound therapy in neurosurgery with computer vision, acoustic wave modeling, operator learning. I am affilated with the [Neuroengineering Lab](https://neuroengineering.bme.jhu.edu/) and the [HEPIUS Lab](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology-neurosurgery/research/hepius).

  I recieved my Bachelor's of Science (Dec 2019) and Master of Engineering (May 2020) degrees at Cornell University. At Cornell, I was a member of the [Space Systems Design Studio](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/), with the research focus of spacecraft electrical system development. After completing my Masters, I spent a year as a computational neuroscience research scientist at Yale School of Medicine in the Blumenfeld Lab.
